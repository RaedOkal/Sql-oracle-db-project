### In this project, an Oracle Database was utilized to complete several tasks. The following steps were taken:

A new user was created in Oracle Database and necessary permissions were granted to the user.

The newly created user was used to log in to the Oracle Database.

A new database was created using data from various tables in the University database.

Real data obtained from the University was inserted into the tables.

SQL manipulation was carried out on the tables to answer questions related to the data as required using SQLPlus.

The work was spooled using the spool command with SQLPlus.

Overall, the project involved creating a new user with the necessary permissions, creating a new database, inserting real data, performing SQL manipulation to answer questions related to the data, and spooling the work using the spool command with SQLPlus
